you may have experience that, your manager ask the whole team to join a meeting for brain storm for a single topic. Why we need many people to discuss problem together? Because we have limit of our own.We 
are confine to our own capability, knowledge base, personal experience, therefore when looking at a problem, we always have our own bias or blind spot, and we can't solve any problem by our own and 
view point of others would bring new idear, new view point and bring new hope for solving the problem.

The same principle apply to attention mechanism, if we only use only one attention, we may only capture some part of info from the sentence, and the algorithm may loss important info from the sentence. If
we simulate the human meeting, that is we compute multiple batch of attention weights at parallel and combine all those attention weights together, then we can capture more precise info for the given 
sentence or artice and prevent the limit or bias of one attention weights.
